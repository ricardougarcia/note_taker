// The following HTML routes should be created:

// - `GET /notes` should return the `notes.html` file.

// - `GET *` should return the `index.html` file.

// The following API routes should be created:

// - `GET /api/notes` should read the `db.json` file and return all saved notes as JSON.

// - `POST /api/notes` should receive a new note to save on the request body, add it to the `db.json` file, and then return the new note to the client. You'll need to find a way to give each note a unique id when it's saved (look into npm packages that could do this for you).
